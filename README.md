### Here'll be all other educational code samples apart from ML/DA.

heat_threads.c -- simulation of linear heat spread in time, using several parallel threads (works only on linux). The program gets number of threads, number of segments and observation time in arguments of main() and writes sequence of system thermal states to the output file. Using gettimeofday function we also print how long it works and plot time to number of segments dependence in python (hear_threads.ipynb) for 1-16 number of threads. 

Files starting with "DB" - educational data base for auto repair shop with queries, views and triggers implemented in MSSQL. Create script creates DB after deleting its previous version if exists and fills in some values. Other files contain different queries for created DB with all neccessary comments.
