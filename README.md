heat_threads.c -- simulation of linear heat spread in time, using several parallel threads (works only on linux). The program gets number of threads, number of segments and observation time in arguments of main() and writes sequence of system thermal states to the output file. Using gettimeofday function we also print how long it works and plot time to number of segments dependence in python (hear_threads.ipynb) for 1-16 number of threads.
